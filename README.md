python homework
NOTE:
I was pretty sick all week. I'm only starting this Sunday night on a lot of cough medicine. I do not think I will be able to finish
correctly on time. As such, I'm still turning something in, but it is this. I plan to continue work on it until I understand, but failing
to post is unacceptable. (Update 12/10/18)
